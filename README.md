# Salt States of FFRN

This Repository contains the saltstack configuration of [Freifunk Rhein-Neckar](https://www.freifunk-rhein-neckar.de/).

It is used by the [FFRN Admins](https://forum.ffrn.de/g/NOC) to easily deploy stuff accross all servers.

It it partly self written and partly inspired (and some stuff copied) from the [Salt States](https://git.darmstadt.ccc.de/ffda/infra/salt) of [Freifunk Darmstadt](https://darmstadt.freifunk.net/).
